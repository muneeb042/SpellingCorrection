# SpellingCorrection
This mini-project focuses on spell correction using a Python script. The primary goal is to enhance the 
accuracy of text data by identifying and correcting misspelled words while maintaining proper alignment
between original tokens and their corrected counterparts. If there is no correctly spelled word found for
a token, it's printed as default.

# Key Features:
1. Spell Correction with SpellChecker
2. Token Alignment
3. Input and Output Handling
